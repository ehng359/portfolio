# portfolio

## Purpose
This is the files necessary for creating my own website detailing my recent projects, research, and other creations! This is a mere documentation of my journey as I craft my own personal portfolio and hopefully serve as a inspiration to additions for others!

This will include:
- [ ] projects completed throughout the year (with links to hosted code)
- [ ] experimentation with inclusion of design into the website
- [ ] current research
- [ ] what I am currently working on
- [ ] things currently learning @UCLA
- [ ] methods of personal contact and potential collaboration

## Goals
Genuinely wanting to document the whole process with regards to the development of a website in a particular framework and connecting parts together to make a seamless experience!
